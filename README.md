# SatChecker
SatChecker is a satellite position prediction tool from the [IAU CPS](https://cps.iau.org/sathub/) (IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference) SatHub group. It uses [TLEs](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/documentation/tle-fmt.php) (two-line element sets) from [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/), and eventually other sources, to provide predictions of satellite positions at a given time and location. It also provides additional information like range, on-sky velocity, and an "illuminated" flag for each prediction point.
